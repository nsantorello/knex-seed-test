### Testing the seed feature

* Run `npm install`, or `npm install -g nsantorello/knex` to install globally.
* Create seed files with `knex seed:make <name>`.
* Run all seed files for the environment with `knex seed:run`.
* You can configure the `directory` for the environment's seed files in `knexfile.js`, such as in this project.
